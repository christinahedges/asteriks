		 thus THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A LARGE PROPOSAL. We wi

		ne body elongation and/or binarity.Relevance to K2:This study wi
		ll obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in 
		the Kepler field of view during campaigns 11-13  to determine if
		 these objects originated in the Kuiper Belt and later migrated 
		and are amenable to the operational characteristics and constrai
		nts of the mission and defined observing fields.}
