	title = {K2 photometry of a large sample of trans-Neptunian objects},
	abstract = {Our recent studies (Pal et al. 2015, 2016, Kiss et al 2016) have
		 demonstrated that the K2 mission is an excellent opportunity to
		 obtain rotational properties of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs).
		 Using long-cadence Kepler photometry focusing on the stationary
		 points of the apparent tracks of these objects, light curves wi
		th excellent quality can be obtained, from which one can constra
		in the rotation period, surface inhomogeneities, the shape of th
		e object and decide, whether the true rotation period correspond
		s to a single-peaked or double-peaked solution.We propose to obs
		erve 13+9+9 Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects throughout the 
		Campaigns 11, 12 and 13, respectively, of the K2 programme. From
		 our list of proposed targets, 8 also have been observed in the 
		framework of the ``TNOs are Cool!'' open-time key programme of t
		he Herschel Space Observatory (Muller et al. 2009), therefore an
		 unambiguous rotational characteristics can be combined with an 
		unambiguous diameter and surface albedo for these objects. This 
		sample of ours covers various dynamical types of the population 
		of objects outside the main asteroid belt, including 5 Centaurs,
		 13 classical objects, 4 scattered disk objects and 9 resonant o
		bjects. One of the resonant objects has 1:1 mean-motion resonanc
		e with Neptune (namely 2012 VU85, a Trojan of Neptune) as well a
		s there are four Plutinos, i.e. objects in 2:3 mean-motion reson
		ance with Neptune.None of targets having Herschel/PACS thermal p
		hotometry have a currently known accurate rotation period (note:
		 2005 TB190 has ground-based observations confirming variability
		 but with several aliases, see also Thirouin et al. 2012). Hence
		, the K2 time series also aids the proper interpretation of ther
		mal emission measurements. All of the targets having Herschel ph
		otometry fall on silicon for quite long time (60+ days) with the
		 exception of Borasisi. This object is a binary system with a pe
		riod of 46.3 days (Noll et al. 2004). Hence, the total time of 1
		3+10 days when K2 is capable to perform photometry would not cov
		er the binary period, however, even this shorter track could con
		firm or constrain whether the objects have a synchronous rotatio
		n or not.Due to the number of these targets and the comparativel
		y large pixel cost w.r.t the stellar sources, we prioritize our 
		targets according to their brightness (i.e. the effective S/N ra
		tio of the rotational light curve) as well as the existence of t
		hermal infrared data. Our top priority objects include all of th
		e objects having Herschel/PACS photometry. We also indicated 201
		2 VU85 with priority 1. Priority 2 objects are either bright or 
		have interesting dynamical properties. We note that even the fai
		ntest (priority 3) objects have comparable brightness to that of
		 2002 GV31. This object was also successfully observed by K2, yi
		elding a folded light curve with good signal-to-noise ratio and 
		an unambiguous rotation period (Pal et al. 2015). We also note t
		hat the first minor body discovered in the outer Solar System, (
		2060) Chiron fell on silicon during Campaign 12. Due to the diff
		erent nature of K2 data acquisition, the science case of (2060) 
		Chiron is described in a separate proposal.Proposed targets:}

	abstract = {Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus are two of the solar system's
		 most intriguing bodies. Titan's thick atmosphere and complex hy
		drologic and climatic cycles are rivaled only by Earth's, while 
		Enceladus' vast water plumes are a geophysical enigma and an ast
		robiological opportunity rolled into one. Both are examples of t
		he solar system's "ocean worlds" and stand as potential targets 
		for future New Frontiers-class missions due to their relevance t
		o understanding the diversity of habitable environments within t
		he solar system and the potential emergence of life beyond Earth
		.We propose to target both Titan and Enceladus for photometric m
		onitoring with K2. They are on silicon for over 5 days during K2
		 Campaign 11. Observations from K2 will allow us to probe global
		 atmospheric activity across Titan on short timescales continuou
		sly over the period of observability. This will provide unique t
		emporal sampling and may highlight as-yet unseen physics in Tita
		n's utterly unique atmosphere. Similarly, observations from K2 w
		ill allow us to search for photometric indications of Enceladus'
		 plumes in backscattered light, and monitor them for variability
		 on timescales much shorter than those probed by Cassini. These 
		observations will constrain the size distribution of particles i
		n Enceladus' plumes and may provide hints toward the sources of 
		energy powering the plumes.Both observations can serve as unique
		 proofs of concept for space-based photometric monitoring of the
		se outer solar system worlds, and will support the development o
		f future missions to characterize them.}

	title = {Lightcurves of Trojan and Hilda asteroids: Insight into Planetary Migration in the Early Solar System},
	abstract = {Studies of the small bodies of the solar system reveal important
		 clues about the condensation and formation of planetesimal bodi
		es, and ultimately planets in planetary systems. Dynamics of sma
		ll bodies have been utilized to model giant planet migration wit
		hin our solar system, colors have been used to explore compositi
		onal gradients within the protoplanetary disk, &amp; studies of 
		the size-frequency distribution of main belt asteroids may revea
		l compositional dependences on planetesimal strength limiting mo
		dels of planetary growth from collisional aggregration. Studies 
		of the optical lightcurves of asteroids also yield important inf
		ormation on shape and potential binarity of asteroidal bodies. L
		ightcurves of Hilda and Trojan asteroids populations yield key i
		nformation about the primordial shape and binary fraction of the
		se small body populations and their origins. Milli-mag Kepler ph
		otometry will tightly constrain both of the latter characteristi
		cs. These 2 populations are in resonances with Jupiter &amp; col
		lisional frequencies within these populations are the lowest wit
		hin inner solar system small body populations. Results from the 
		WISE survey suggest that ~20% of Trojans &amp; ~40% of Hildas ar
		e either extremely elongated objects or binaries. Kepler optical
		 light curves are required to confirm these controversial findin
		gs. Ground based surveys are not optimal for this type of photom
		etric variability study due to large amounts of observing time r
		equired &amp; nightly aliasing effects on lightcurves. Kepler ho
		wever is ideal for this type of photometric survey of asteroid v
		ariability due to the photometric stability of the observing pla
		tform and the correspondence between the C11 field and the L4 Tr
		ojan cloud. Methodology: We have identified 100 objects for stud
		y in the Hilda and Trojan asteroids to be studied with Kepler in
		 C11-13 with magnitudes of m_V &lt; 20. Due to the overlap betwe
		en the Campaign 11 field and the L4 Trojan cloud, our request fo
		r data represents 70 objects Campaign 11, 23 objects in Campaign
		 12 &amp; 7 objects in Campaign 13. These objects are not statio
		nary within the Kepler fields, rather they move across the field
		, resulting in a mean time in the Kepler field of view on active
		 silicon of 24 days. Due to the motion of these targets, the Kep
		ler Science Center assesses solar system program as containing m
		ore targets than proposed number of objects, (In C8, 6 Hilda tar
		gets are assessed as 4847 targets by the Kepler Science Center),
		 thus THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A LARGE PROPOSAL. We wi
		ll utilize data obtained with the 30 minute Kepler cadence to de
		termine rotational periods for our selected targets. The ratio o
		f lightcurve amplitudes will subsequently be utilized to determi
		ne body elongation and/or binarity.Relevance to K2:This study wi
		ll obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in 
		the Kepler field of view during campaigns 11-13  to determine if
		 these objects originated in the Kuiper Belt and later migrated 
		and are amenable to the operational characteristics and constrai
		nts of the mission and defined observing fields.}
